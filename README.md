This library provides additional functions that can be used with the [hypergraph library](https://github.com/PhilChodrow/hypergraph) by Phil Chodrow.

The additional functions are\
Local clustering coefficient for hypergraphs\
Hierarchy coefficient for hypergraphs\

Furthermore, we provide some of the protein data used in the manuscript.
