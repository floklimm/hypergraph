# hypergraph

This library provides additional functions that can be used with the [hypergraph library](https://github.com/PhilChodrow/hypergraph) by Phil Chodrow.

The additional functions are\
Local clustering coefficient for hypergraphs\
Hierarchy coefficient for hypergraphs\
ER-like Random graph model\
Plotting the representing graph of a hypergraph with [Netwulf](https://pypi.org/project/netwulf/)





Furthermore, we provide some of the protein data used in the manuscript.
